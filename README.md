My code si for studying energy transfer in the FMO protein, a pigmentâ€“protein complex located in the light harvesting complex of the photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobium tepidum. 
The FMO protein consists of a protein scaffold that surrounds a system of 7 strongly coupled pigment molecules that we model as a network of coupled two-level systems.
Dynamic evolution of the system is governed by the Lindblad master equation, so in this way, my code solves a system of coupled first-order linear ODEs and evaluates discord-like quantum correlationes.
